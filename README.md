# Text analysis and Sentiment analysis in R
This objective of this project is to analyze tweets about travel from Twitter by comparing between USA, Europe, and Asia.
I used Twitter API to download the tweets and save it to CSV file to analyze in two parts
  1. Correlation analysis
  2. Sentiment analysis

This project shows you what people think when they talk about traveling in USA, Europe, and Asia.
